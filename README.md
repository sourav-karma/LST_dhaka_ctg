Calculating Land Surface Temperature for the year 2015, 2018, 2021 and relating it with NDVI, NDWI, NDBI




Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a pivotal role in evaluating the urban living conditions, particularly in the face of expanding cities and population growth. As urban areas extend both vertically and horizontally, green spaces, open areas, and water bodies are being replaced by built-up structures, leading to elevated LST. This study focuses on Dhaka city, aiming to derive LST and establish relationships with three remote sensing indices: NDVI, NDWI, and NDBI. Landsat 8 data from the summer seasons of 2015, 2018, and 2021 were utilized, employing the LST retrieval mono-window algorithm. Results indicate a substantial +58.73% net change in areas with surface temperatures >32 °C from 2015 to 2018, accompanied by a -5.09% reduction in areas with temperatures <24 °C from 2018 to 2021. NDVI and NDWI values decreased, while NDBI significantly increased from 2015 to 2021. Negative correlations between LST and NDVI were observed, with R2 values ranging from 0.29 to 0.30, signifying a moderate correlation. Similar to NDVI, NDWI exhibited a negative correlation with LST, with R2 values ranging from 0.08 to 0.14, indicating a poor correlation. Conversely, a robust correlation was found between LST and NDBI, showing a strong correlation among all three indices, with R2 values ranging from 0.57 to 0.62. This study underscores the intricate dynamics between LST and urban indices, shedding light on the evolving thermal landscape of Dhaka city and emphasizing the significance of sustainable urban planning in mitigating temperature extremes.
